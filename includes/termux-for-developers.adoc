include::header.adoc[]

== Creating and using a desktop development environment (with Docker)

=== Prerequisites

. A Bash shell running on macOS, Linux or Windows (with Cygwin
installed).
+
WARNING: Until now, the steps below were tested only in macOS and
Ubuntu Linux operating systems.
+
. Docker installed. (of course! ðŸ˜„)

=== Clone paulojeronimo/termux-docker

Here I present you a nice and productive way to create your
applications before package than and liberate their use.

----
$ mkdir ~/lab-termux && cd $_
$ git clone https://github.com/paulojeronimo/termux-docker && cd `basename $_`
----

NOTE: You can also fork this repo and use your own! ðŸ˜ƒ +
You will see that my repo is a fork too (with some improvements) from
https://github.com/xeffyr/termux-docker[xeffyr/termux-docker^]!

=== Build and run your own Docker image

Copy `config.sample.sh` to `config.sh` and configure your {DockerHub}
username on it.

----
$ cp config.sample.sh config.sh
$ vim config.sh
----

Invoke `build-all.sh` script:

----
$ ./build-all.sh
----

Invoke `run.sh` script:

----
$ ./run.sh
----

== Test your Docker image to build this site

=== Clone paulojeronimo/termux-presentation

----
$ cd ~/lab-termux
$ git clone https://github.com/paulojeronimo/termux-presentation && cd `basename $_`
----

=== Copy the run.sh and config.sh (from termux-docker)

----
$ cp ../termux-docker/run.sh ./termux-docker.sh
$ cp ../termux-docker/config.sh ./
----

=== Build this site by creating a termux-docker container

----
$ ./termux-docker.sh
----

Sample output for the command above:

----
include::termux-docker.txt[]
----

Call `build.sh` inside the shell provided by the container:

----
$ ./build.sh
Building content in termux environment ...
Skipping the call to "build-multipage-version" for termux environment!
Reason: termux can not run Docker (Yet! Maybe someday!?)

WARNING: In the first execution of the command above, the `build.sh`
script will install the required packages. So, the output will be more
extensive than showed.
